# athena-ticker-experiment

## purpose of experiment
To explore the ease of use of Athena in AWS. 

## note
The data file was too large to add here so instead I will share the <a href="https://quantquote.com/historical-stock-data">link<a/> to download the data for yourself in case you want to reproduce what I have done with this experiment. Click on the 'free data' tab and then the 'download' link at the bottom of that folder.
